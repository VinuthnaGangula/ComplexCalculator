# ComplexCalculator

## Problem Statement

To write functions to compute **sum**, **difference**, **multiplication** and **division** of two **complex numbers** that are represented by a **structure**(refer the structure below)

``` 
typedef struct{
    float real;
    float imaginary;
}complex_no; 
```

## Work 

1. Created folders **inc** - for header files, **src** - for features or functions, **test** - for test cases, **unity** - for Unity files.
2. **inc** has the structure and function declarations.
3. **src** has the required functions definitions.
4. **Makefile** for compilation.
